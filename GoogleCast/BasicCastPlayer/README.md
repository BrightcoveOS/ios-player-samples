# Basic Cast Player

At this time Brightcove GoogleCast plugin does not support DRM or ads and only supports `HLSv3`, `DASH` and `MP4` source types. If you need to support any additional features, source types or want to customize anything else related to casting with Google's SDK you can use the `GoogleCastManager` class included in the `BasicCastPlayer` sample app.

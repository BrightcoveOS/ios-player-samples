# SwiftUI Custom Controls

The CustomControls SwiftUI sample project is configured to support the IMA Plugin for Brightcove Player SDK for iOS. By default the IMA related code is commented out so that you can build the project without the IMA SDK dependency.

If you wish to enable the IMA functionality you will need to download the [IMA SDK](https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/ios/download), add the XCFramework to the project and uncomment the IMA specific code.

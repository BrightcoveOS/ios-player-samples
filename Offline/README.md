Offline Player
--------------

The Brightcove Native Player SDK allows you to download and play back HLS videos, including those protected with FairPlay encryption. Downloaded videos can be played back with or without a network connection.

### Requirements:

- iOS 10.3+
- Xcode 9+
- Brightcove Native Player SDK v6.2.2+
- Brightcove Account with Dynamic Delivery

iOS does not allow FairPlay-protected video to display in a simulator, nor does it allow video downloads to a simulator, so it's important to develop on an actual device.

### Reference:

See ["iOS App Developer's Guide to Video Downloading and Offline Playback with HLS in the Brightcove Player SDK for iOS"](https://github.com/brightcove/brightcove-player-sdk-ios/blob/master/OfflinePlayback.md) for details.

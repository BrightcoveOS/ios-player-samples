# Basic Omniture Player

### ADBMobileConfig.json

Use of this player sample requires an Adobe Analytics account and the custom ADBMobileConfig.json file associated with that account. For this player sample to run correctly, you must replace the included sample ADBMobileConfig.json file with your own.

### Adobe SDKs

The Adobe Analytics SDKs are **not** included in this sample project. To fetch the Adobe Marketing Cloud libraries, download the following archives, unzip them and add them to your project directory:

```
https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/media-sdks/archive/refs/tags/ios-v2.3.0.zip
https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/mobile-services/archive/refs/tags/v4.21.2-iOS.zip
```

### Brightcove SDKs

Next, install the CocoaPods.

```
pod install
```

Open, build and run `BasicOmniturePlayer.xcworkspace`.

Brightcove Player SDK for iOS Samples
=====================================
Learn more about the [Brightcove Native Player SDKs](https://support.brightcove.com/brightcove-native-player-sdks).

ios-player-samples.git is a collection of sample applications for the Brightcove Player SDKs for iOS and tvOS, organized by subject area. An installation of [CocoaPods][cocoapods] 1.0.0 or higher is required to download the sample dependencies.

### Prerequisites

1. CocoaPods 1.0+
1. Xcode 10.0+

### About CocoaPods
To ensure you are using the latest releases of the Brightcove software components, update your Podspec repository before building any of the sample applications by running the following on the command line:

```
pod repo update
```

### About Swift
The Swift sample apps are written in Swift language version 4.2.

### Instructions

Unless otherwise instructed, samples can be run by following these steps:

1. From the project directory, run `pod install`.
1. Open the corresponding `.xcworkspace` file.
1. Where the Podfile's pod directives do not specify that a dynamic framework is being installed, there is some additional setup required to build and run the project:
    - Locate the `bcovpuiiconfont.ttf` file in the Pods/Brightcove-Player-SDK/ios/BrightcovePlayerSDK.framework folder.
    - Add this file to your Xcode project listing so that the font file is copied into the app bundle.
    - In the built app's bundle, the font file should end up at the same level as the app's Info.plist file.
    - The font file supplies some of the BrightcovePlayerUI interface elements, but it does not need to be listed in the plist itself.
1. There are README.md files in several of the samples that provide additional setup steps that are specific to those examples.

Note: If you intend to use these samples offline, be sure to run Cocoapods before going offline in order to download the required dependencies.

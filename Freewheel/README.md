#Basic Freewheel Player

The Freewheel SDK **is not** included in this pod. You **must** manually add the Freewheel SDK - *AdManager.framework* - to your project. The pod will however add all the libraries required by AdManager.framework.

To add the AdManager framework to your project:
 
1. Drag the AdManager.framework file from the Finder into the Frameworks group of the BasicFreewheelPlayer Project of the Xcode workspace.<br/>
1. Add the folder where the AdManager.framework is located to the "framework search paths" Build Settings field.
